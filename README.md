# House-Prices---Advanced-Regression-Technique
I registered for a data science competition on Kaggle to gain some experience in Python and machine learning. It is a perfect competition for data science students who have completed an online course in machine learning and are looking to expand their skill set before trying a featured competition.

I had the opportunity to practice data cleaning and feature engineering and built a predictive model using supervised machine learning (multiple linear regression) in Python. The goal was to predict the sales price for each house. For each ID in the test set, I must predict the value of the SalePrice variable.
